## How to use

1.  **Install Gatsby**

    Visit the official [Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/) for installation instructions.

2.  **Clone this repo**

    Once you have Gatsby installed, navigate back to this folder in your command line and run:

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

3.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    The site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

    Edit `src/pages/index.js` to see your site update in real-time! This code is far from perfect but feel free to remix and use for your own portfolio.
