              <p className="paragraph">
              Using a mix of qualitative data and user feedback, in 2020 we identified a handfull of 
              issues with Discord‚Äôs registration and onboarding.
              </p>
              <p className="paragraph">
                These problems were:
              </p>
              <ul className="case-list">
                <li>We didn‚Äôt educate users about  our core primitives (servers, channels, etc).</li>
                <li>The path after registeration was confusing and often led to states where the user had little idea of what to do next.</li>
                <li>Finding your friends on the app was difficult.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="paragraph">
                I‚Äôd be remissed if I didn‚Äôt mention the amazingly talented designers that I now work with on this team. 
                San Chung, Selina Her, and Brett Johnson all now produce the designs on our team. This case study will 
                focus on the projects I primarily designed or co-designed as we built the team to what it is today.

              <p className="paragraph">
              User testing taught us that our current buttons and inputs didn‚Äôt seem interactable. Our app‚Äôs splash page 
              didn‚Äôt tell users anything about the product, and steps of registration looked inconsistent from being updated piece by piece.
              </p>
              <p className="paragraph">
              I started design by updating the visual design of the steps we knew we needed for registration and login. That way we could 
              build from a baseline we knew was working and our future iterations would be consistent.

              <h2 className="h2">Onboarding help</h2>
              <p className="paragraph">
              During user testing we heard common phrases like ‚ÄúWhat is a channel?‚Äù, ‚ÄúAre voice channels like a phone call?‚Äù. 
              Channels are how users organize their server by topic, so a new user not understanding one of the core 
              primitives of the product was a big contributor to why they felt confused.
              </p>
              <p className="paragraph">
                Our solution was to improve the empty states of the most commonly visited parts of the app 
                along with tutorial messages to introduce these concepts.
              </p>
              <p className="paragraph">
                We tested this approach with interactive prototypes and users first. After seeing success with our user tests we 
                released this project as an experiment and shortly after to production in early 2020.

              <p className="paragraph">
                San Chung and I co-designed this project into production across Desktop, Android, and iOS.
                Discord Servers are hard to understand for new users. They‚Äôre a primitive that can be used for communities of 
                800k people, an private book club for 10 of your fellow hobbyists, or for a classroom of 100.
              </p>
              <p className="paragraph">
                By providing a list of templates to build from, we could teach users what Discord could be used for 
                and guide them through the process resulting in a less confusing user experience.
              </p>
              <p className="paragraph">
                Server templates were designed around our most common uses cases ‚Äúa place for friends‚Äù, ‚Äústudy group‚Äù, 
                ‚Äúan art community‚Äù. This screen did double duty of education about the product and helping them onboard.

              <p className="paragraph">
                Next we built phone registration to make signing up for Discord easier. This feature had two benefits, less 
                friction to register and it allowed us to work on social graph features as our next project.
              </p>
              <p className="paragraph">
              This project spanned across all three platforms we support(Desktop, Android and iOS). Phone registration is a 
              good example of a project that seems simple in practice, but requires a considerable amount of design for all of it‚Äôs various states (update, remove, add phone number etc).

              <h2 className="h2">Finding your friends</h2>
              <p className="paragraph">
                To make finding people you know on Discord easier, we built ‚ÄúFind Your Friends‚Äù which let users upload their contacts to find existing Discord users.
              </p>
              <p className="paragraph">
                One of the challenge of this project was staying privacy focused. We let users decide whether or not other people could 
                find them. We had to balance this messaging and make it simple to dig further into your privacy preferences. We used 
                user research to help us message this feature since it‚Äôs uncommon with other modern social media networks.
              </p>
              <p className="paragraph">
                Another problem we had to solve was how to surface this feature for new users vs existing users. 
                We decided to promote the feature before launch to help educated our existing users on how it would work. 
                <em>Selina Her</em>, the designer I mentioned earlier worked side by side on this feature. She owned how it would fit within
                Discord's onboarding while I had started on how the feature a few months prior for existing users.
